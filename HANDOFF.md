# HANDOFF — Psych AI Research Handbook

## Current state

- Artifact: 《心理学研究的 AI 进阶手册》
- Current published edition: v1.2, 2026-09-24 — Multi-Agent Workflow / Agent Governance
- Historical frozen edition: v1.1, 2026-09-16
- Author: Hao Xie / GitHub: How-Tze
- License: CC BY 4.0 (confirmed 2026-09-16)
- Versioned PDF and DOCX under `release/` are frozen release artifacts; preserve both v1.1 and v1.2.
- `chapters/` contains the current v1.2 Quarto reading edition; the `v1.1` tag preserves the earlier source.
- The manually authored DOCX table of contents was removed from HTML because Quarto supplies navigation.
- One-cell case/example tables from Word were converted to Quarto callouts for web readability; wording is preserved.

## Editorial boundary

Do not silently change frozen v1.1 or v1.2 arguments, claims, methods, or references while doing deployment work. Layout-only HTML fixes, broken links, typo corrections, and accessibility improvements are acceptable if recorded. Substantive content changes belong to a later version.

## 2026-09 website maintenance

- The public site audit found repeated book-title labels in chapter navigation, duplicate Quarto/authored numbering, one literal Markdown heading on the homepage, and one remaining one-cell conversion table.
- The maintenance branch adds explicit navigation labels, disables Quarto's redundant automatic section numbers, repairs the homepage heading boundary, and converts the non-tabular example task to a callout without changing its wording.
- Web presentation now includes clearer release/changelog entry points, a wider tablet reading column, long-link wrapping, and an explicit keyboard focus indicator.
- QA covered desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts; generated internal links and anchors, downloads, navigation, callouts, tables, references, and the homepage were rechecked. `quarto render` passes.
- The frozen v1.1 PDF/DOCX files and substantive handbook prose were not changed.
- Unresolved: the current Quarto installation emits non-visible `zh-CN` translation warnings for “Abstract”; monitor upstream/tooling changes unless this becomes reader-visible.
- The website maintenance branch was merged into `main` as `78646c7`. Later merges and deployments require an approved release gate or explicit human authorization.

## Current phase

As of 2026-10-14, the active phase is **v1.3 capability chapter authoring**, status REVIEW. TASK-003/004 are DONE. TASK-005 delivered three complete candidates and checked teaching examples; TASK-006 responds to the user's concern that the new prose is abstract and method learning teaches the method more than learning with AI. It rewrites that chapter around questions and follow-ups, polishes theory/analysis, and adds a complete writing/revision candidate. Start at `drafts/v1.3/README.md`; the branch remains `docs/v1.3-authoring-preparation`, draft PR #3.

Validation: TASK-005's actual computations and independent numerical checks are retained unchanged. Original numeric tables, equations and figures survive the language revision; writing examples match the reference outputs. Five-page isolated preview, 162 local references and desktop/390px layout checks passed; exercises and technical details expand correctly. Authoring Gate for the exact revised prose is next; no new chapter prose is integrated or published. Continue later chapters with the concise Chinese editing requirements in the authoring package, prioritizing literature and research design. Humanizer-zh was read as an editorial reference, not globally installed or executed.

Published `chapters/`, `release/`, `index.qmd` and `_quarto.yml` are unchanged against main. The pre-existing untracked `docs/project_audit_report.md` remains untouched. The companion Start Guide v0.11 was approved, merged (PR #1/#2), tagged and released on 2026-10-13; all 31 live pages and eight downloads passed checks. Its release does not authorize a handbook v1.3 publication.

## Important future backlog

For a later handbook version, add a section on AI-assisted open-science release workflows: maintain complete local project assets, deliberately select non-sensitive public artifacts, generate/update README/data dictionaries/code/environment metadata, scan for secrets and sensitive content, and maintain public releases when analyses change. Human review remains mandatory for anonymization, consent, and third-party data licensing.
